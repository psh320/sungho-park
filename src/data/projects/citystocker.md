# CityStocker

## Project Introduction

CityStocker is my final year project at City University of Hong Kong, born from witnessing countless people losing their money in the cryptocurrency market during 2021-2022.

**Problem Statement:**
The cryptocurrency market's extreme volatility led to significant financial losses for inexperienced traders who jumped into trading without proper knowledge or practice.

**Solution:**
I wanted to create a platform where people could practice cryptocurrency trading without risking real money, while also providing backtesting capabilities for customizable trading algorithms based on real market data.

**Key Innovation:**
The platform features a customizable algorithm system where users can write trading code directly in the website's code editor using provided classes, enabling algorithm trading without any complex setup.
