# BobPlace

## App Introduction

BobPlace means "place where you have meals" (Bob means meal in Korean).

The number of people using food delivery services is increasing, and delivery fees are becoming increasingly expensive. Therefore, many people are starting to use pickup services to save on delivery fees.

**Problem Statement:**

- Expensive delivery fees burden both users and small restaurant owners
- High commission rates reduce restaurant profit margins
- Customers are discouraged from dining out due to convenience of delivery

**Our Solution:**

- Motivate users to go outside for meals using gamification and points system
- Provide restaurants with a better way to attract customers with improved business margins
- Create a win-win ecosystem for both customers and restaurant owners

BobPlace uses gamification to encourage users to dine out at physical restaurants, solving the delivery fee problem through two complementary applications: one for customers and one for restaurant owners.

## Key Features

### Gamification System

- **Point-based Rewards**: Earn points for dining out at participating restaurants
- **Achievement Badges**: Unlock badges for trying new cuisines and visiting different locations
- **Leaderboards**: Compete with friends and local community members
- **Challenge System**: Daily and weekly challenges to explore new dining experiences

### Social Dining

- **Friend Network**: Connect with friends and share dining experiences
- **Group Challenges**: Team up with friends for group dining rewards
- **Restaurant Reviews**: Share and discover restaurant recommendations
- **Photo Sharing**: Capture and share memorable dining moments

### Location-based Features

- **Restaurant Discovery**: Find nearby participating restaurants
- **GPS Check-in**: Verify restaurant visits for point accumulation
- **Local Promotions**: Access exclusive deals from local businesses
- **Neighborhood Exploration**: Discover hidden gems in different areas

## System Design

The BobPlace ecosystem consists of two interconnected mobile applications with a robust backend infrastructure supporting real-time communication and location-based services.
